.SYNOPSIS
    Launch a UE5 game with the motion-vector capture environment set correctly,
    wait for its real render process, and inject mv_hook.dll into it.

.DESCRIPTION
    Every step this automates is a documented way to lose a session:

      * MV_DUMP_DIR / MV_ENGINE_VERSION reach the render process only by
        INHERITANCE from the shell that launches the game. Setting them against
        an already-running game does nothing, and the failure is silent - the
        capture just lands in the wrong place, or meta.txt records no engine
        version and the offline decode falls back to a default for channels 2/3.
        This script sets them before Start-Process, so they are inherited.

      * The launcher is not the renderer. Valfreyja.exe spawns
        Skyrunner-Win64-Shipping.exe; Oxi.exe spawns Oxi-Win64-Shipping.exe.
        Injecting into the launcher hooks a process with no D3D12 device.
        This script waits for the *-Win64-Shipping child and injects there.

      * Some titles exit immediately unless their working directory is their
        own folder. Start-Process is given -WorkingDirectory accordingly.

      * Injecting into a process that is still starting up has crashed a
        target before. This script waits -SettleSeconds after the render
        process appears.

      * A reinjection restarts the capture index at 0 and overwrites
        vel_00000.bin. The default dump directory here is timestamped and
        fresh, and a non-empty one is refused without -Force.

      * mv_hook.dll already loaded in the target changes what injection means
        (same path = a reference-count bump, no second DllMain; different path
        = a second independent copy double-patching the same vtables). On a
        shared machine this happens without anyone asking. This script
        enumerates the target's modules and refuses to make it worse.

    See DEBUGGING.md ("Something double-injects mv_hook.dll into Skyrunner,
    unprompted") and NEXT.md ("Things that will bite") for the incidents
    behind each of these.

.PARAMETER Game
    Path to the game executable to launch - the launcher (Valfreyja.exe,
    Oxi.exe) is correct here; the child renderer is found automatically. With
    -AttachOnly this may instead be a bare process name
    (Skyrunner-Win64-Shipping.exe) of something already running.

.PARAMETER EngineVersion
    major.minor, e.g. 5.2. Recorded into meta.txt and required by the offline
    decode for channels 2/3, which 5.2 and 5.7 pack differently. Inferred from
    the executable name for titles this repo knows; otherwise you must pass it,
    because a wrong value here silently corrupts V.z and bHasPixelAnimation.

.PARAMETER DumpDir
    Where captures go. Defaults to a fresh timestamped directory under %TEMP%.

.PARAMETER Hook
    Path to mv_hook.dll. Defaults to the repo's Release build.

.PARAMETER RenderProcess
    Process-name pattern for the real renderer. Defaults to *-Win64-Shipping,
    the UE5 shipping-build convention.

.PARAMETER SettleSeconds
    How long to wait after the render process appears before injecting.
    Default 8. Racing startup has crashed a target.

.PARAMETER AttachOnly
    Do not launch anything; inject into an already-running process. The MV_*
    environment variables CANNOT be applied this way - the script says so
    rather than pretending they took effect.
