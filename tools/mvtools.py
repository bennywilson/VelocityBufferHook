"""Decoding helpers for the raw buffers dumped by the hook.

The hook writes untouched GPU bytes plus a manifest.json describing them
(docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md sec 4.1), so all format knowledge lives here rather
than in the injected DLL - keeping the in-process code as small and as
low-risk as possible.

load_dump() is the only supported door into a dump (sec 4.3): it gates on
schema_version, refuses an unsealed dump unless told not to, and returns a
Dump whose surfaces are typed by how their identity was established -
IdentifiedSurface (found by search, has a coverage tally) or KnownSurface
(given by an API contract, e.g. colour - no score, no signals, because there
was nothing to search for). Every decode function below still takes a plain
dict (`meta`), not a Surface - Dump.meta reconstructs that dict from the
manifest so this file's numerically-sensitive decode code did not need to
change shape for this migration.

#     EncodedV.xy = V.xy * (0.499f * 0.5f) + 32767.0f / 65535.0f;
#
# So the stored value is a SQUARE-ROOT encoding of the clip-space delta, not a
# linear one. VELOCITY_ENCODE_GAMMA is `#define`d to 1 for every feature level
# at or above SM5 (Common.ush:238), i.e. unconditionally for a D3D12 PC title -
# there is no cvar and no per-project setting to check.
#
# The inverse, DecodeVelocityFromTexture() at Common.ush:2107:
#
#     V.xy = EncodedV.xy * InvDiv - 32767.0f/65535.0f * InvDiv;   // InvDiv = 1/(0.499*0.5)
#     #if VELOCITY_ENCODE_GAMMA
#         V.xy = (V.xy * abs(V.xy)) * 0.5;

#
# V is then a CLIP-space delta, current minus previous, with x right and y up.
# Two more engine facts fix the rest of the convention:
#
#   * `PrevScreenPos = ScreenPos - DecodeVelocityFromTexture(...).xy`
#     (PostProcessAmbientOcclusion.usf:1203, VisualizeMotionVectors.usf:78, and
#     every other consumer) - so V points forward, and stepping *back* to the
#     previous frame subtracts it.
#   * `ScreenPosToViewportUV(S) = float2(0.5 + 0.5*S.x, 0.5 - 0.5*S.y)`
#     (Common.ush:1658) - clip to UV flips Y.
#
# Composing those two gives the backward (current -> previous) UV displacement
# this module returns:
#
#     du = -0.5 * V.x        dv = +0.5 * V.y
#
# which is where the X-negative / Y-positive sign pattern comes from. It was
# guessed correctly before; it is now derived.
#
# Jitter: the encoded vector is already de-jittered. Calculate3DVelocityBase()
# (VelocityCommon.ush:9) subtracts View.TemporalAAJitter.xy from the current
# screen position and .zw from the previous one before differencing, so the
# TAA/TSR sub-pixel offset is not in the buffer and must not be removed again.
#
# Why the old fitted constants looked right: linearising the sqrt encoding
# around the dominant motion in the station capture (a train at ~11 px/frame
# across a 1212-wide velocity buffer) gives an apparent slope of
#     (11/1212) / (sqrt(2*11/1212) * sqrt(2) * 0.2495) = 0.191 UV per unit,
# against the -0.1758 / +0.1991 that were fitted. The fit was not wrong about
# its own data - it measured the local tangent of a curve and reported it as
# the curve. That is also the whole of the "~10x disagreement with Common.ush":
# 2.004 is the coefficient of the sqrt term, 0.19 is a chord across it, and the
# ratio between them is a function of how fast the scene happened to be moving.

# Engine version.
#
# The x/y encoding above is stable across the versions checked: UE 5.2 and
# UE 5.7.1 both guard VELOCITY_ENCODE_GAMMA on `FEATURE_LEVEL >= FEATURE_LEVEL_SM5`
# and both apply the identical `V.xy = (V.xy * abs(V.xy)) * 0.5` on decode. So
# the displacement decode ports between them unchanged.
#
# The DEPTH channels do NOT. 5.7.1 steals the bottom 1-2 bits of channel 3 to
# carry bHasPixelAnimation / temporal responsiveness:
#
#   5.7.1:  V.z = asfloat((z << 16) | (w & VELOCITY_Z_LOW_MASK))   // 0xFFFE or 0xFFFC
#   5.2:    V.z = asfloat((z << 16) |  w)                          // no mask at all
#
# On 5.2 those bits are ordinary float32 mantissa. Masking them off loses (a
# negligible amount of) precision, but *reporting bit 0 as a flag* would be
# presenting the low mantissa bit of a float as a semantic boolean - which is
# the exact mistake this project already made once, when channel 2's bimodality
# was written up as "a flag, not a velocity component" (it is the sign bit of
# this same float). Same error, one bit lower down. So the flag is only decoded
# where it is known to exist.
#
# Verified endpoints only. 5.2: no mask, no flag. 5.7.1: masked, flag present.
# The introduction point in between has NOT been checked - anything else warns
# rather than guessing, because a silently wrong boolean is worse than a noisy
# one.
#
# One caveat on the 5.7 entry, found while porting and worth stating because it
# is the same class of thing this table exists to prevent. VELOCITY_Z_LOW_MASK
# is not a constant even within 5.7.1 (Common.ush:2049-2055):
#
#     #if VELOCITY_ENCODE_TEMPORAL_RESPONSIVENESS
#         #define TEMPORAL_RESPONSIVENESS_MASK  0x3
#         #define VELOCITY_Z_LOW_MASK           0xFFFC     <- two bits stolen

#         #define VELOCITY_Z_LOW_MASK           0xFFFE     <- one bit stolen
#     #endif
#
# and VELOCITY_ENCODE_TEMPORAL_RESPONSIVENESS depends on
# VELOCITY_SUPPORT_TEMPORAL_RESPONSIVENESS, a per-shader-platform property we
# cannot read from a dump. 0xFFFE below is therefore the *narrower* of the two
# possibilities, chosen deliberately: if the title actually uses 0xFFFC, this
# leaves bit 1 in the mantissa, which perturbs V.z by ~1e-7 relative - nothing.
# Guessing the other way round would mask off a real mantissa bit AND report
# bit 1 as part of a flag it is not. Both bits are low mantissa either way, so
# V.z is safe; only bHasPixelAnimation (bit 0) is claimed, and bit 0 is stolen
# under both branches.
