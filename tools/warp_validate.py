"""Warp-and-difference validation of the extracted motion field.

Takes frame N-1, warps it by the motion field captured at frame N, and
compares the result against the real frame N. If the vectors are correct (and
correctly decoded, signed and scaled) the warped image should match frame N
noticeably better than the un-warped frame N-1 does.

Only pixels where the velocity buffer was actually written are scored - UE5
writes SceneVelocity for dynamic objects only, leaving static geometry to be
reconstructed from camera matrices by the consuming shader. Scoring the
unwritten region would be measuring something this buffer never claimed to
contain.

WHAT THIS TEST IS WORTH, stated up front because it is easy to over-read.

Two things changed since the version of this script that produced the numbers
quoted in earlier drafts, and both change how much the result means:

  * The decode constants are no longer fitted to this test. They are now read
    out of Common.ush (see mvtools.py). The multiplier sweep in step 1 used to
    be circular - it recovered the value it had itself produced - and is now an
    independent check: nothing downstream tuned it, so a peak at 1.0 is real
    evidence that the source-derived decode is right.

  * There are now control conditions. "Warping by this field reduces error" is
    a weak claim on its own: a single rigid shift would do that too on a scene
    dominated by one large moving object. Step 2 scores the real field against
    a sign flip, against the best possible single global translation, and
    against a deliberately mismatched frame's field. The per-pixel field has
    to beat all three before "per-pixel correct" is a fair description.

It still scores only the ~8-13% of pixels the velocity buffer wrote, using a
mask derived from that same buffer. It is not a full-screen result.
