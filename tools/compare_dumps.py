"""Are two capture dumps equivalent?

The regression oracle for the Surface migration (docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md): every
phase that is supposed to change no behaviour is verified by capturing a dump
before and after and running this.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE, because it decides how this compares:

A dump is NOT byte-identical run to run, and no refactor will make it so. Which
frames land depends on slot contention - all four ring slots being in flight
makes the hook skip a frame by design (see g_noFreeSlot in capture.cpp) - and
that is a function of GPU/CPU timing, not of the code under test. Two runs of
mv_testhost at 240 frames were measured at 84 and 86 captured frames.

What IS reproducible is the CONTENT of a given game frame. Measured across two
runs sharing 61 game frames: velocity, depth and colour all byte-identical, 61
of 61, for all three. So the comparison keys on the game frame index that
frames.csv records - not on the capture index, which is just a counter of what
was drained and means nothing across runs.

Consequence worth stating: this proves equivalence on the frames both runs
happened to capture. A phase that broke capture for, say, only the first frame
after a reopen could hide in the frames one run missed. The intersection size is
therefore printed and gated - a comparison over a handful of frames is reported
as WEAK rather than passed.

Usage:
    python compare_dumps.py <before_dir> <after_dir>
    python compare_dumps.py <before_dir> <after_dir> --min-common 40

Exit code 0 if equivalent, 1 if not, 2 if the comparison was too weak to mean
anything.
