"""Render the captured motion field as a video alongside the gameplay.

Three panels: the game's own back buffer, the extracted SceneVelocity field on
its own, and the field composited over the frame. Panel 2 is deliberately
shown raw rather than only as an overlay. SceneVelocity holds velocity for
*dynamic and world-position-offset geometry only* - 11-13% of pixels in the
station capture (the train, background characters and signage, and the weapon
viewmodel), 7-9% in the corridor capture where the viewmodel is the only thing
moving, ~21% in the Skyrunner flight captures. Static-geometry motion is
reconstructed from camera matrices inside the consuming TSR/motion-blur shader
and is genuinely not in this buffer, so a mostly-black panel is the honest
picture of its contents rather than a bug in the visualisation.

The hue-for-direction colouring here is the optical-flow (Middlebury)
convention, imported by us. Unreal draws nothing like it, so this view has no
engine ground truth to be checked against - the in-game overlay deliberately
shows the raw channel mapping instead. See DEBUGGING.md.

Usage:  python make_video.py <dump_dir> [out.mp4] [--preview] [--still N]
        [--still N]             write one PNG of frame N (or the middle frame if
                                N is omitted) instead of a video - this is what
                                produces the README's lead figure
