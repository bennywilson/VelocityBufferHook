"""How distinctive is the velocity buffer's barrier pattern, really?

The project's identification argument has two halves, and only one of them was
ever tested. The descriptor filter (1212x760, R16G16B16A16_UNORM) picks a
resource; the barrier analysis then shows that resource behaves exactly as
SceneVelocity should - two transitions per frame, strictly alternating
RENDER_TARGET <-> ALL_SHADER_RESOURCE, no UAV barriers, no state-continuity
violations. Clean, and circular: the barrier analysis only ever ran on
resources that had already passed the descriptor filter, so it could confirm
"the resource I picked behaves right" but never "nothing else does".

The hook now profiles every resource the identify pass walks past (see
DumpBarrierProfiles in hook/src/d3d12_hook.cpp) and writes them to
%TEMP%\\mv_barrier_profile.log. This reads that file and asks the question the
other way round: of all the resources in the frame, how many exhibit the
velocity buffer's signature?

If the answer is one, or a handful, then runtime behaviour alone comes close to
identifying the velocity buffer - no RenderDoc capture needed to crib a
descriptor from, and the technique transfers to a title you do not own. If the
answer is dozens, the descriptor filter is doing the real work and the barrier
pattern is corroboration rather than identification. Either result is worth
having; only one of them was assumed before.
