"""Checks decode correctness on a synthetic velocity grid representative of
WPO (world-position-offset) pixels - motion that is not pure camera motion,
which is exactly the population wind-animated foliage belongs to and which no
image-matching reference in this project resolves reliably either.

Companion to mv_testhost.exe --wpo-encode-test <dir>, which renders a known
(Vx, Vy, Vz) grid through the real EncodeVelocityToTexture()/
VELOCITY_ENCODE_DEPTH path (transcribed exactly from Common.ush, in
testhost/src/wpo_encode_test.cpp) and dumps the result in the same
meta.txt/*.bin shape a real capture uses. This script regenerates the same
grid independently and runs the UNMODIFIED, already-shipping mvtools decode
functions against the dump, then checks two things.

The grid dimensions come from the dump's own meta.txt, so those cannot drift.
The VALUE ranges below (VX_RANGE/VY_RANGE/VZ_RANGE) are a hand-kept duplicate
of the lerp ranges in wpo_encode_test.cpp's PSMain, and nothing checks that
the two still agree - the dump records the encoded result, not the formula
that produced it. Change one side and you must change the other, or this
script silently compares against the wrong "truth" and reports a failure that
is really a fixture mismatch. What it checks:

  1. The decoded value is close to the true value used to drive the shader
     (informative - bounded by UNORM16 quantization, reported but not the
     pass/fail gate, since the gate below is the tighter, better-founded one).
  2. The decoded value matches decode(round_to_unorm16(encode(true value)))
     to near float32 precision - i.e. mvtools' decode function correctly
     inverts whatever value a real GPU actually wrote, modulo only the
     documented, deliberate loss of channel 3's bottom bit to
     bHasPixelAnimation. This is the actual pass/fail gate: if the real
     hardware quantizes differently than the round-to-nearest model here
     (a genuinely interesting finding), or if mvtools' decode has a bug that
     only shows up away from the near-zero, static-geometry-dominated values
     real captures mostly contain, this is where it would show up.

# than via the closed-form derivative, so it needs no separate derivation to
# trust. A 3x safety factor allows for the real GPU's rounding mode
# disagreeing with the round-to-nearest model above without hiding an actual
# decode bug, which would miss by much more than one quantization step.
