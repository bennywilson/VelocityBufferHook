"""Test the SceneVelocity decode against measured motion, per pixel.

What this replaces, and why, because the old version's number is quoted in
places and should not be trusted:

The previous derive_scale.py regressed the per-frame *spatial mean* of the raw
velocity channels against the per-frame spatial mean of Farneback optical flow
- about 18 scalar pairs for a whole capture. Two things are wrong with that.
The mask spans objects moving in different directions, so averaging attenuates
each side by a different factor and the resulting slope is not an estimator of
anything per-pixel. And Farneback is unreliable on exactly this footage (large,
smooth, low-texture surfaces), where it reports near-zero and looks confident.
Its output, -193/+207 px per UNORM unit, is what the "~10x disagreement with
Common.ush" was built on.

This version regresses per pixel, over the written region, against block
matching (blockmatch.py) rather than optical flow. It asks three questions:

  1. WHAT IS THE EXPONENT?  Fit  measured_px = k * |code_offset|^p  in log-log.
     This is the part that does not assume the answer. p ~ 1 means the encoding
     is linear in the stored code; p ~ 2 means the stored code is a square root
     of the displacement, i.e. VELOCITY_ENCODE_GAMMA is on. The engine says 2
     (Common.ush:2062); the point of fitting it is to not have to take the
     engine's word for it, since the shipping binary's shaders are what
     actually ran, not the source tree on disk.

  2. IS THE DECODE UNBIASED?  Regress measured against mvtools.decode_velocity.
     A correct decode gives slope 1, intercept 0. This is a validation, not a
     fit: nothing here feeds back into the constants.

  3. HOW DOES THE OLD LINEAR DECODE COMPARE?  Same regression against the
     legacy constants, so the improvement is a number rather than a claim.

Needs a capture with real motion. On a near-static capture the log-log fit has
no dynamic range and the script says so instead of returning a number.
