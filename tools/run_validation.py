"""Run every offline check against a dump and write results/validation.txt.

The point of this script is reproducibility. The validation numbers quoted in
README.md and DEBUGGING.md were, for most of this project's life, produced by
script revisions that were never committed - at one point the figure in
results/ had panel labels that matched no code in the repo. A reader had no way
to check any of it without a capture of their own, and neither did I after the
capture that produced them was overwritten.

So: one command, every tool, output captured verbatim into results/, including
the failures. If a number appears in the write-up it should be findable here.

Usage:  python run_validation.py [dump_dir] [tag]

`tag` names the title the dump came from and is appended to every output file
(results/validation_<tag>.txt, warp_validation_<tag>.png, ...). It exists
because this project now covers more than one game, and the first runs against
a second title overwrote the first title's committed results - the same class
of loss as the capture that was overwritten and could not be regenerated, and
harder to notice, because the file still exists and still looks plausible.
Omit it for the original results/validation.txt.
