"""Decode vs measured motion, compared over a REGION rather than per pixel.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT JUST check_decode.py AGAIN

`derive_scale.py` regresses decoded against measured displacement at every
confidently-matched pixel. That is the strongest form of the test when it works,
and on the second title in this project it does not work - not because the
decode is wrong but because the *reference* is unusable there:

  * the written region is wind-animated foliage, thin high-frequency structure
    with background visible through it, so a 17px correlation window routinely
    spans two surfaces moving differently and returns a compromise;
  * the title applies heavy motion blur, which makes consecutive frames look
    more similar at smaller offsets and biases any matcher low;
  * per-pixel matching reports slope ~0.7 against a correct decode, and filtering
    harder makes it worse, not better (slope peaks at 0.73 keeping the top 50%
    of matches by confidence and falls to 0.39 keeping the top 3%). A reference
    that degrades as you demand more of it is not measuring what you think.

This tool asks a weaker question that the same footage can actually answer: over
one region, does the decode predict the displacement that region visibly
underwent? It matches a large crop by normalised cross-correlation, which has no
small search radius to be blind above and reports its own match quality, and
compares that against the median decoded displacement over the same pixels.

It cannot show the field is correct *per pixel* - only per region, per frame.
That is a real limitation and it is the reason this file does not replace
derive_scale.py. What it does show, on footage where the per-pixel route is
compromised, is whether the decode has the right scale and sign at all - and
because it works across a wide magnitude range, it also discriminates the
square-root encoding from a linear one, which is the question a single frame
cannot answer.
