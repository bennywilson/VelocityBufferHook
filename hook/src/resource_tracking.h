//
// KNOWN LIMITATION, stated because it is a real hole rather than a theoretical
// one: this set holds bare pointers and no references, so if a resource is
// released and a later allocation reuses its address, the new resource is
// treated as already-seen and never identified. For candidates that hole is
// closed (they are ref-held, below); for the ~8000 resources the identify pass
// merely walks past, it is not. The failure mode is missing the velocity
// buffer entirely rather than acting on the wrong one - loud, not silent -
// and in practice identification completes within the first few seconds, well
// before the transient allocator has recycled much. Closing it properly means
// re-running GetDesc() on every barrier, which is exactly the unbounded
// exposure g_identifyBudget exists to prevent.

// GetDesc() on - a considered bet rather than a proven-safe pattern - and it
// used to be a bare atomic in d3d12_hook.cpp that ran out in silence.
//
// Silence was the problem. In the skyrunner_reproject session every
// identification log line - shortlists, near-misses, both searches - stopped
// dead at t+96s and nothing was ever printed again for at least the remaining
// 47 minutes the session ran, which is what an exhausted budget looks like from
// the outside and is indistinguishable from "the game stopped creating
// resources". Whether that is
// what happened there is not established; that it CANNOT BE TOLD APART is, and
// this is the line that tells them apart next time.

//
// Only used when identification is reopened: the set exists to make GetDesc() a
// once-per-resource cost, so without clearing it a second search would walk past
// every resource in the process in silence and find nothing. Costs one more
// GetDesc() per live resource, once.
//
// The budget refill is not decoration. Reopening after the budget had run out
// was a guaranteed no-op - the seen set was cleared and then every resource was
// rejected one layer down for want of budget, so the search would have run
// forever and found nothing, loudly reporting that it had reopened.
