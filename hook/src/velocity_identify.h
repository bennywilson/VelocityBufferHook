// Finding SceneVelocity on a title whose descriptor you do not already know.
//
// Two independent filters:
//
//   1. STRUCTURE - properties derived from the engine's own rules, not one
//      observed instance. UE5 picks the velocity format in
//      FVelocityRendering::GetFormat and its create flags in
//      GetCreateFlags; both are small closed sets (see the tables in
//      velocity_identify.cpp, each with its engine citation).
//
//   2. BEHAVIOUR - a lenient binary gate (produced as a render target and
//      read as a shader resource on at least half the observed frames; see
//      BehaviourGate). Anything stronger - the strict two-events-per-frame
//      RT<->SRV cycle, no UAV barriers, no continuity violations - is scored
//      evidence, not a requirement: it held on Oxi and failed on a second
//      title. See CollectSignals.
//
// Neither filter is applied until #2 has had a settling window to
// accumulate, so identification costs a couple of seconds at startup.
//
// When more than one resource survives, the top two scores decide: a margin
// of 2+ picks the top scorer. Ambiguous picks are treated as failure.

// SceneVelocity at the same SceneTexturesConfig::Extent.

// Frames since the identified resource last took a RENDER_TARGET ->
// shader-resource edge. Unlike VelocityPassIsSilent this reports the raw

// out to be shorter than that.
uint64_t FramesSinceVelocityEdge(uint64_t frame);

// Diagnostic, not a decision: while the identified resource is stalled,
// checks whether another texture of the same format has taken over its
// edge - i.e. the engine moved the velocity pass to a different target
// rather than stopped rendering it. Needed because resource tracking stops
// examining new resources once its identification budget is spent, so a
// later-allocated replacement is otherwise invisible; this looks at the
// barrier directly and only costs a GetDesc during a stall.
//
// Returns true once the resource has held the edge long enough to be
// adopted as a second velocity target (the target game switches between
// R16G16B16A16F and R16G16F) - caller should start treating it as
// capturable. Adoption is bounded internally; past the limit this returns
// false rather than adopt indefinitely.
